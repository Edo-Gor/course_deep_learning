\# Deep learning 



\## Repository description



This repository contains code related to the Deep Learning course by

Mike X. Cohen on Udemy:



https://www.udemy.com/course/deeplearning\_x



The majority of the "base" code is adapted from material developed by the

course instructor. I have made minor modifications to experiment with it.



The "exercises" and especially the "code challenges" sections contain more

of my own contributions, where I added creative input beyond the provided

material.



If you are exploring this repository out of an interest in deep learning,

I highly recommend the course itself, it is an excellent resource that

provides both solid theoretical and practical foundations.
